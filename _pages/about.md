Hello! I am a recent PhD graduate from the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. 

My work focused on what happens in the brain when we read and understand language, and how we use statistical reasoning while processing language. I also explored how humans interact with voice-AI like Siri and Alexa, and how our understanding of conversational norms affects our experiences with these devices. 

You can read more about these projects and view some sample data and analyses [here](https://nicoledodd.github.io/projects/).
