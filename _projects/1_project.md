My primary research interest lies in exploring the question of what makes some sentences more difficult to process than others, and why. My research investigates this question within the context of existing sentence processing theories, including memory- and expectation-based theories, and additionally tests how good-enough/noisy-channel processing contributes to misinterpretations in low-frequency structures. Previous research on this topic has largely focused on Indo European languages, and my research takes steps toward diversifying existing literature by studying Standard Arabic, an under-studied language that exhibits typological features that are also under-represented in psycholinguistic research.
