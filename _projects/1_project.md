My primary research interest lies in exploring the question of what makes some sentences more difficult to process than others, and why. My research investigates this question within the context of existing sentence processing theories, including memory- and expectation-based theories, and additionally tests how good-enough/noisy-channel processing contributes to misinterpretations in low-frequency structures. Previous research on this topic has largely focused on Indo European languages, and my research takes steps toward diversifying existing literature by studying Standard Arabic, an under-studied language that exhibits typological features that are also under-represented in psycholinguistic research.

My preliminary work in this area tested memory- and expectation-based processing theories in Arabic relative clauses through a self-paced reading task. The results of this work, which was accepted for [publication](https://escholarship.org/content/qt51d7m5np/qt51d7m5np.pdf) and presentation at CogSci 2022, demonstrated support for expectation-based theories of sentence processing; however, our results raised new questions about good-enough/noisy-channel processing in Arabic object relative clauses.

My future work will further test patterns of Arabic language processing through a series of eye-tracking tasks. I plan to further investigate contributions of memory limitations and violated expectations to overall processing difficulty, then test the tradeoff of input and statistical expectations in sentence interpretation.
